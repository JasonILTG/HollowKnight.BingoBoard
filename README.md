# HollowKnight.BingoBoard

A tool for viewing Bingosync boards in-game. Current features include:

- In-game togglable board display, that connects to Bingosync and shows you the board, including which colors have marked which goals.

- Simple GUI for pasting in the Bingosync room ID and setting the toggle key.

- Ability to highlight goals (similar to starring them on Bingosync) by clicking on them - cycles through white -> red -> blue -> green.

- Sound notification (when the board refreshes once every 5 seconds or when you toggle it) for when the state of the board changes (this can be disabled).

Planned future features:

- Improved goal shortening (some goals are too wordy to fit and get truncated)

- Automatic detection and indication of when you complete a goal

- Ability to mark goals on Bingosync, in addition to just showing them.
